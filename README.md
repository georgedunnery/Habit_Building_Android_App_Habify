## Q&A
### Problem the app solves:
A prevalent issue among people today is the inability to achieve their goals for personal development. People frequently set goals like going to the gym , eating healthy, or getting on a better sleep schedule, but fail to achieve them or are only able to maintain the habit for short periods of time. The problem is acknowledged in society at large by cultural traditions like setting New Year’s resolutions. Habify is aimed at solving this problem by providing an intuitive framework for setting habits and being held accountable to actually achieve them.

Growth - Habit tracking

### How is Habify better?
Many habit tracking apps have overwhelming user interfaces that are hard to decipher. Habify will set itself apart by focusing on providing an elegant and intuitive design without sacrificing the core functionality that people need to succeed. Habify will also make use of device sensors to verify user activity and create a more compelling experience.

### What is innovative (elegant  / surprising)? 
The core innovations include the verification of reported accomplishments, displaying the counts of other users who accomplished a similar task, and the concept of maintaining habit streaks to achieve goals (consider you are on day 20 of a 21 day habit - are you really going to skip today when you are so close to finishing?!). Habify aims to provide an elegant user interface that is functional and informative without overwhelming the user the way similar apps do.

### Long term engagement, why will it be addictive?
Long-term engagement will be a priority, since people using the app will most likely already suffer from chronic distractions. Therefore, Habify will aim to keep users engaged through a multi-faceted approach. Intelligently timed notifications will be leveraged to gently remind users of the goals they set for themselves. Users will feel like they are “leveling up” their profile by accomplishing their real world goals and be encouraged to compete with their friends by incorporating an easy way to share the profile on social media. Habits with a defined maintenance period will have a progress bar that iterates as consecutive successes are reported - but if the user misses a scheduled task (according to the frequency they chose), the progress bar resets back to zero!

### Top weaknesses and how will they be addressed?
The biggest weakness of the app will be long term engagement, which is discussed at length above. Motivation will also be an issue, which heavily ties in with long term engagement in this case. The two main motivators currently planned are the continuation of habit streaks (consecutive successes) and to display the counts of users who also accomplished a similar habit today (for example, “50,000 other people went to the gym today”). Another issue will be monetization; users are expected to be competent at creating their own habits fairly quickly, so selling more in depth habits may be ineffective. Monetization will also need to take place through non-intrusive ads, or some additional features offered in a paid version of the app (or at least an ad-free version).

Can we realistically design, build, and test the application by the deadline, April 18th 2020?
Yes.
