### 0. Prepopulated tables
- days  : the 7 days of the week as full strings, ex. "Monday"
- badges: list of all possible badges that can be earned

### 1. Create User
- Gather data for columns in user table
- Insert an Event entry with today's date
- Insert a User entry using the data and Event foreign key

### 2. Create Habit
- Gather data for columns in habit table
- Use the user_id from the current user, realistically it'll probably just be 0 for a single user
- Determine Event: query to see if an event already exists for today, if not create one
- Determine Location: query to see if the given location already exists, if not create one (can be null -> no gps verification)
- Insert Habit entry using FKs: user_id, event_id as created, location_id as location
- Generate entries in the Schedule table: for example, if the habit is daily, then there should be 7 entries (habit_id x days)

### 3. Create Records
- When a user successfully completes a habit, or fails to do so
- Determine Event: query to see if an event already exists for today, if not create one
- Insert a Record entry using the event_id foreign key, record the time, and evaluation (true = succeeded, false = failed)

### 4. Create Awards (Need some kind of integration to run accomplishment checks)
- When some achievement occurs, a badge will be associated with a habit and an event
- Determine Event: query to see if an event already exists for today, if not create one
- Insert an Award entry using habit_id, badge_id, event_id as earned_on, set display = false (user will have control later in profile)
